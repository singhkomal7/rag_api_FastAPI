# RAG API with FastAPI

This project is for building an AI-powered API using modern web frameworks like FastAPI, combined with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) to create intelligent APIs that answer questions based on your own knowledge base. 

The project was completed using the **"Nextwork"** documentation and tutorial.


The project was split into 4 parts consisting of building a RAG API with FastAPI, containerization with docker, deployment to kubernetes, and automation testing with GitHub Actions.
---

## Part 1 - Building a RAG API with FastAPI

1.  Set up Python and Ollama for local AI development

2.  Built a RAG API using FastAPI, Chroma, and tinyllama

3.  Created interactive API documentation with Swagger UI

4.  Tested the API with both curl and Swagger UI

---

## Part 2 - Containerizing with Docker

1.  Build Docker images from Dockerfiles

2.  Push images to Docker Hub for distribution

3.  Pull and run images from Docker Hub

---

## Part 3 - Deploying to Kubernetes

1.  Set up a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube

2.  Create Kubernetes Deployments to orchestrate containers

3.  Create Kubernetes Services for stable networking

4.  Deploy and access containerized applications in Kubernetes

---

## Part 4 - Automating Testing with GitHib Actions

1.  Set up Git version control for your code.

2.  Create and manage a GitHub repository.

3.  Structure your knowledge base with a scalable docs folder.

4.  Implement mock LLM mode for deterministic testing.

5.  Build semantic tests to catch data quality issues.

6.  Create GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing.

7.  Detect data quality issues before they reach production.
